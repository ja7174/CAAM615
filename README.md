We consider a neuron with a large dendritic tree such as the Lobula Giant Movement Detector (LGMD)
neuron and attempt to build its Hines matrix to ultimately obtain eigenvalue decomposition. Once obtained,
we use the eigenvalues and eigenvectors to further inspect the relationship between the mother and the
daughter dendrites. Previously, we have seen a simple forked dendrite and constructed its Hines matrix from
the current balance equation and cell circuitry. The resulting almost-symmetric Hines matrix is acted upon
by suitable transformations to bring it to symmetry. We build up the LGMD model from the simple forked
model by adding upon and tweaking the already existing cell circuit until it resembles the LGMD model. We
then use a similar strategy to convert the resulting asymmetric matrix to a symmetric one and then exploit
its symmetry to obtain its eigenvalues and eigenvectors
